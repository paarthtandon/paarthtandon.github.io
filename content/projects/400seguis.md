Seguis is my friend's Discord server.
This repository contains a Discord bot that implements various features that members of the server requested.
Some examples are member activity tracking and a fishing minigame with server wide leaderboards.
For a full list of features look at the `cogs` directory.

The bot is built using `discord.py` and data is stored on MongoDB.
