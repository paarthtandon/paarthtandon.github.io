[MusicGen](https://ai.honu.io/papers/musicgen/) is a music generation model developed by Meta.
This project sets up a pipeline for fine-tuning MusicGen on a personal dataset.

Check out the [Github repo](https://github.com/paarthtandon/personal-music-gen/) for more details.
It also contains some example generations after training on Alison Halo's "Eyedazzler".
